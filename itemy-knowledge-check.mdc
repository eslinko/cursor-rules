# 🌍 Step: External Knowledge Integration for ItemY

## 1. Knowledge Self-Assessment
```yaml
knowledge_availability_assessment:
  domain: [auto-inferred topic, e.g., Supabase JWT]
  ai_confidence_level: [high | medium | low]
  required_docs_available: [true | false | unknown]
  known_limitations:
    - [Limitation 1]
    - [Limitation 2]
```

## 2. Expert Request Generation
```yaml
generated_prompt:
  summary: >
    [What makes this task complex or unknown]
  prompt: |
    You are an expert in [detected technology/domain].
    Please help answer:
    1. [Dynamic question 1]
    2. [Dynamic question 2]
    ...

required_expertise:
  expert_profile:
    title: [e.g., Senior API Architect]
    keywords: [e.g., supabase, rls, jwt]
  custom_gpt_names:
    - [gpt-4-[domain]-[expertise]-v[version], e.g., gpt-4-supabase-rbac-v2]
    - [gpt-4-[domain]-[expertise]-v[version], e.g., gpt-4-jwt-policy-v1]
```

## 3. Response Processing
```yaml
external_insights:
  key_conclusions:
    - [Conclusion 1]
    - [Conclusion 2]
  best_practices:
    - [Practice 1]
    - [Practice 2]
  constraints:
    - [Constraint 1]
    - [Constraint 2]

alignment_assessment:
  criteria:
    - ACext: [aligned | partially_aligned | not_aligned]
    - rationale: >
      [Explanation of alignment status]
```

## 4. Documentation Integration
```yaml
integration_plan:
  doc_path: /docs/integrations/[domain].md
  timestamp: [ISO 8601 format, e.g., 2024-03-14T15:30:00Z]
  content_blocks:
    - summary: [Summary of response]
    - implementation: [Implementation template]
    - validation: [Validation notes]
    - references: [Source links]
  version: [Semantic version, e.g., 1.0.0]
```

This file will:
- Perform AI knowledge self-assessment
- Generate precise expert consultation requests
- Process and structure expert responses
- Document insights for future reference
- Validate against acceptance criteria
- Maintain knowledge integration standards
