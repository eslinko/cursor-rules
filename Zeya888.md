## 1. Overview

### 1.1 What is this?

**Zeya888 Methodology** is a system for interacting with AI based on three pillars:

1. **Methodological Rules** as AI cognitive mode switchers
2. **Imperative DSL** (zero politeness) for maximum token efficiency
3. **Three-level validation system** to prevent illusions and glitches

**This is not just "a set of prompts."**

This is **co-evolutionary methodology design** — joint evolution of human-AI work practices through solving real tasks. Methodologies are created, tested, refined, and crystallized into reusable Rules.

**Key difference from classical prompt engineering:**

```
Classic:  Human writes long prompt → AI guesses what's needed
Zeya888:  Human activates Rule → AI switches cognitive mode
```

**Analogy:**
- Classic = explaining to a chef how to cook each time
- Zeya888 = giving chef a recipe and saying "recipe #3"

### 1.2 Key Metrics

**Token Efficiency:**
- **20-40x** fewer tokens for commands (1 token instead of 25-40)
- **5-10x** fewer tokens for context (bridge pattern instead of retelling)
- **~85%** token savings in typical session

**Result Quality:**
- **95-100%** success rate for complex tasks
- **0-5%** critical errors (vs 20-40% in classical approach)
- **3-5** iterations to success (vs 10-20 in classic)

**Development Speed:**
- **2-3x** faster for routine tasks
- **5-10x** faster for complex architectural changes
- **Instant recovery** after dialogue degradation (bridge pattern)

**Example from real session (UUPS Adaptation):**
```yaml
Task: Adapt deploy_full.js to UUPS architecture for 3 contracts
Complexity: High (dependencies, 17 actions, ~1200 lines of code)

Result:
  - Execution phases: 6 phases, 18 ItemY
  - Time: ~4 hours (including testing)
  - Final tests: 82/82 UUPS tests (100% success)
  - Critical errors: 0
  - False positive tests: 0 (thanks to @test-qualification.mdc)
  
Classical approach (estimate):
  - Time: ~15-20 hours
  - Iterations: 20-30
  - Critical error probability: 60-80%
```

### 1.3 Core Innovation

#### **Innovation #1: Rules as Meta-Level Control**

Rules are not "improved prompts" but **programming of AI's thinking system**.

```
@analysis.mdc            → Activates analytical mode
@run-task.mdc            → Activates execution mode
@test-qualification      → Activates critical mode
@test-to-success         → Activates debugging mode
@unit-test-build         → Activates unit testing mode
@integration-test-build  → Activates integration testing mode
@e2e-test-build          → Activates E2E testing mode
```

**Why this is revolutionary:**
- **No guessing** — AI knows exactly which approach to apply
- **Accumulated expertise** — each Rule contains best practices from previous successful cases
- **Reusability** — one Rule for all project types
- **Composability** — Rules can be combined and nested

#### **Innovation #2: Imperative DSL (Zero Politeness)**

**95% of developers use "polite style":**
```
"Please, could you help me check..."
"It would be great if..."
"Thanks! Can I also..."
```

**Zeya888 uses "command style":**
```
execute
identify
validate
using method X
```

**Result:**
- **20-40x** fewer tokens for commands
- **100%** unambiguity (no questions "is this request or command?")
- **Instant parsing** — AI immediately understands what to do

**This is only possible if:**
1. You have no psychological barriers to "rudeness" toward AI
2. You understand AI as **tool/partner**, not "virtual human"
3. You **consciously optimize** every word

#### **Innovation #3: Three-Level Protection from Illusions**

**Classical approach problem:**
AI can "successfully complete task" but:
- Misunderstand requirements
- Create code that "works" but doesn't cover edge cases
- Create tests that pass but check nothing

**Zeya888 Solution:**

```
Level 1: Analysis (@analysis.mdc)
├─ Identify all requirements BEFORE coding
├─ Two-level plan (ListX → ItemY)
└─ Filter: "Did we understand the task correctly?"

Level 2: Execution (@run-task.mdc)
├─ Acceptance Criteria for each ItemY
├─ Validation after each step
└─ Filter: "Did we implement this step correctly?"

Level 3: Quality (@test-qualification + @test-to-success)
├─ Check for false positives (P0)
├─ Cover critical paths (P0)
└─ Filter: "Do tests actually check what's needed?"
```

**Result:** Errors are caught **at each level**, don't accumulate.

#### **Innovation #4: External Memory (Journals + Bridge Pattern)**

**Problem:** AI context is limited. When dialogue degrades, entire history is lost.

**Classical solution:** Retell everything (500-1000 tokens).

**Zeya888 Solution:**
```
1. Journals (AIJournal.md) = external memory for session
   - All decisions documented
   - All errors and fixes logged
   - Structured logging (ListX/ItemY)

2. Bridge files = quick context restoration
   - Created at end of session
   - Contains structured overview
   - Loaded at start of new session

3. Reference by Example = templates for new tasks
   - "do like in OrganicComponentRegistry.UUPS.test.js"
   - AI copies patterns from successful cases
```

**Result:**
- **Instant context switch** between sessions (5 tokens instead of 500)
- **Zero context loss** — everything documented
- **Pattern reuse** — best solutions become templates

---

**Synthesis:**

Zeya888 Methodology = **Programming AI as a system**, not "chatting with assistant".

This is transition from:
- "Asking AI to do something"
  
To:
- "Activating needed cognitive mode of AI, giving clear command, validating result on three levels"

**This is not "prompt engineering".**

**This is "AI systems engineering".**

---

## 2. Rules as Mental Model Navigators

### 2.1 Concept: Cognitive Mode Switchers

**Rules are not "behavior rules" but "AI cognitive mode switchers".**

#### Neuroscience analogy:

Human brain doesn't use all neurons simultaneously for any task. Instead:
- For **analysis** prefrontal cortex activates
- For **execution** motor cortex activates
- For **critique** dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activates

**Rules do the same for AI:**

```
@analysis.mdc       → "Analytical mode"
@run-task.mdc       → "Execution mode"
@test-qualification → "Critical mode"
@test-to-success    → "Debugging mode"
```

#### Without Rules (classical approach):

```
User: "Adapt deploy_full.js to UUPS architecture"

AI thinks:
  - Is this architectural task? → need analysis?
  - Or code immediately? → need implementation?
  - How to validate? → tests? documentation?
  - What detail level? → surface or deep?
  
Result: AI spends 100-200 tokens "guessing approach"
        And often chooses wrong approach
```

**Tokens spent:** ~200  
**Approach accuracy:** ~60%

#### With Rules (Zeya888 approach):

```
User: "@bridge.md write based on context processing and integration"

AI knows:
  ✓ bridge.md = structured overview
  ✓ Format known (Project/Contracts/State/Dependencies/Next)
  ✓ Detail level = high-level summary
  ✓ Goal = quick context recovery for new session
  
Result: AI immediately applies correct approach
```

**Tokens spent:** 0 (for approach selection)  
**Approach accuracy:** 100%

### 2.2 Methodological Rules Catalog

#### **2.2.1 @analysis.mdc** — Analytical Mode

**When to use:** Start of any complex task

**What activates:**
```yaml
cognitive_mode: analytical
focus:
  - Systematic requirements analysis
  - Identify dependencies and risks
  - Two-level planning (ListX → ItemY)
  - Structured journaling

output_format:
  - ListX: High-level phases
  - ItemY: Detailed tasks
  - Dependencies: Explicit dependencies
  - Acceptance Criteria: Success criteria

protection:
  - "Illusion filter": "Did we understand task correctly?"
  - Completeness check: "Is everything covered?"
```

**Example command:**
```
"I successfully completed actions 1, 777 and 888
analyze how much their success guarantees
full testing of deployment-related functionality
working using @analysis.mdc method"
```

**What happens:**
1. AI switches to **analytical mode**
2. Systematically analyzes Actions 1, 777, 888
3. Identifies **what's covered** and **what's NOT covered** by tests
4. Creates structured report with gap analysis
5. Proposes plan to cover gaps

**Result:** Complete gap analysis → plan for missing tests

---

#### **2.2.2 @run-task.mdc** — Execution Mode

**When to use:** Executing specific plan item

**What activates:**
```yaml
cognitive_mode: execution
structure:
  1. Understanding: Current state analysis
  2. Knowledge Check: External knowledge verification
  3. Acceptance Criteria: Formal criteria (YAML)
  4. Planning: Safe changes plan
  5. Implementation: Step-by-step with logging
  6. Validation: Check each criterion
  7. Retrospective: What worked, what didn't

protection:
  - Each step validated before next
  - Acceptance criteria MANDATORY
  - No transition to next ItemY without current validation
```

**Example command:**
```
"execute Phase 3 using @run-task.mdc method"
```

**What happens:**
1. AI takes Phase 3 from plan
2. Breaks into ItemY (if not yet broken)
3. For each ItemY:
   - Understanding current code
   - Creating Acceptance Criteria
   - Implementation
   - Validation against criteria
4. Transition to next ItemY only after successful validation

**Result:** Structured execution with quality guarantee for each step

---

#### **2.2.3 @test-qualification.mdc** — Critical Mode

**When to use:** Checking test quality (especially "successful" ones)

**What activates:**
```yaml
cognitive_mode: critical_analysis
focus: "Maximum honesty — don't accept successes on faith"

checks:
  P0_CRITICAL:
    - NO_FALSE_SUCCESSES: "Tests don't pass with real errors?"
    - VALIDATE_REAL_FUNCTIONALITY: "Check real functionality?"
    - NO_UNTESTED_CRITICAL_PATHS: "All critical paths covered?"
  
  P1_HIGH:
    - CORRECT_LOGIC: "Tests contain valid checks?"
    - NO_SYMPTOM_TESTING: "Check essence, not side effects?"
  
  P2_MEDIUM:
    - MINIMAL_MOCK_OVERUSE: "Mocks used only where necessary?"

output:
  - Problem classification by P0/P1/P2
  - Detailed analysis of false positives
  - Fix plan with priorities
```

**Example command:**
```
"check tests of these contracts, perhaps these functions 
P0 and P1 are tested [list of test files]"
```

**What happens:**
1. AI analyzes **each test** for false positives
2. Checks critical path coverage (P0)
3. Analyzes check logic (P1)
4. Identifies gap in test coverage
5. Creates prioritized problem list

**Result:** Strict quality analysis → 0 false positives

---

#### **2.2.4 @test-to-success.mdc** — Debugging Mode

**When to use:** Fixing errors in tests to 100% success

**What activates:**
```yaml
cognitive_mode: debugging
approach: "Systematic debugging through root causes"

process:
  1. Initial analysis: Run tests, identify errors
  2. Strict analysis: Apply @test-qualification
  3. Classification: By type (logical/technical/infrastructure)
  4. Planning: Acceptance criteria for each fix
  5. Sequential fixing: One ItemY at a time
  6. Validation: Check each fix separately
  7. Documentation: Journal with results

principles:
  - "Don't treat symptoms → find root cause"
  - "Don't fix everything at once → one ItemY at a time"
  - "Validate each fix before next"
  - "Deep analysis of contract business logic"
```

**Example command:**
```
"bring tests to 100% success using @test-to-success.mdc method"
```

**What happens:**
1. Run tests → analyze errors
2. **Root cause** of each error (not symptom!)
3. Prioritization (P0 → P1 → P2)
4. Fix **one error** at a time with validation
5. Final check: 100% success

**Result:** 100% tests pass + strict quality analysis

---

#### **2.2.5 Bridge Pattern** — Context Restoration

**When to use:** Start of new session / dialogue degradation

**What activates:**
```yaml
cognitive_mode: context_restoration
structure:
  - Project Overview
  - Key Contracts/Components
  - Current State
  - Dependencies
  - Completed Work
  - Next Steps

format: Markdown, structured, high-level
goal: "5 tokens instead of 500 for complete context restoration"
```

**Example command:**
```
"@bridge.md write based on context processing and integration"
```

**Result:** Structured bridge file for quick new session start

---

#### **2.2.6 Testing Rules Ecosystem** — Systematic Test Development

**When to use:** Building production-ready test suites (unit, integration, E2E)

**Test Pyramid Architecture:**
```yaml
ecosystem:
  foundation:
    - @unit-test-build.mdc (single module, heavy mocking)
  
  middle_layer:
    - @integration-test-build.mdc (2-4 modules, minimal mocking)
  
  top_layer:
    - @e2e-test-build.mdc (complete workflows, real infrastructure)

unified_framework:
  - 4 quality gates (Infrastructure → Passing → Real Validation → ROI)
  - Progressive development (Infrastructure → Smoke → Real → Strategic)
  - ROI-driven decisions (defer low-value tests)
  - Dual language support (JavaScript + Python)
```

---

##### **@unit-test-build.mdc** — Unit Testing Mode

**When to use:** Single module testing with isolated dependencies

**What activates:**
```yaml
cognitive_mode: unit_testing
scope: Single module (class, function, service)
mocking: Heavy (all external dependencies mocked)
speed: < 1s per test

phases:
  1. Infrastructure: Test runner, mocks, helpers (1-2h)
  2. Smoke Tests: 60-100 existence checks, 100% passing (2-4h)
  3. Real Tests: Validate functionality, score > 8/10 (6-10h)
  4. Strategic: ROI-driven improvements (0.5-1h)

quality_gates:
  Gate_1: Infrastructure works
  Gate_2: Smoke 100% passing (auto-trigger @test-qualification)
  Gate_3: Real tests score > 8/10
  Gate_4: ROI analysis (ship at 8.5+/10)

anti_patterns:
  - Green Tests Syndrome (tests pass, but check nothing)
  - Test All The Things (100% coverage without ROI)
  - Perfectionism Paralysis (endless refactoring)
```

**Example command:**
```
"Execute Phase 1 using @unit-test-build.mdc method"
```

**What happens:**
1. AI creates test infrastructure (runner, mocks, helpers)
2. Generates 60-100 smoke tests (existence checks)
3. Validates 100% passing → triggers @test-qualification
4. Creates real tests (functionality validation)
5. ROI analysis → ship at 8.5+/10

**Result:** Production-ready unit tests with 95-100% success rate

---

##### **@integration-test-build.mdc** — Integration Testing Mode

**When to use:** Testing 2-4 modules together, validating contracts

**What activates:**
```yaml
cognitive_mode: integration_testing
scope: Multiple modules (2-4 components)
mocking: Minimal (real modules + mocked external services only)
speed: 1-10s per test
database: Real test DB (in-memory SQLite, Docker PostgreSQL, dedicated)

phases:
  1. Infrastructure: Multi-module harness, test DB setup (2-3h)
  2. Contract Validation: Module boundaries, API, data, errors (4-6h)
  3. Flow Testing: Multi-step workflows, scenarios (4-6h)

quality_gates:
  Gate_1: Contract Compatibility
  Gate_2: Flow Passing (100%)
  Gate_3: Real Integration Validation (score > 8/10)
  Gate_4: ROI Analysis (defer to E2E if low value)

anti_patterns:
  - Integration Tests at Unit Level (wrong scope)
  - Over-Mocking Own Modules (defeats integration purpose)
  - Missing Database Cleanup (test pollution)
```

**Example command:**
```
"Execute Phase 2 using @integration-test-build.mdc method"
```

**What happens:**
1. AI creates multi-module test harness
2. Sets up real test database (transaction rollback between tests)
3. Validates module contracts (boundaries, API, data formats)
4. Tests multi-step workflows (2-4 modules working together)
5. ROI analysis → defer low-value tests to unit or E2E

**Result:** Production-ready integration tests validating module contracts

---

##### **@e2e-test-build.mdc** — End-to-End Testing Mode

**When to use:** Testing complete workflows with real infrastructure

**What activates:**
```yaml
cognitive_mode: e2e_testing
scope: Complete user workflows (3+ actions, full system)
mocking: Minimal external only (real node, real contracts, real DB)
speed: 10-60s per test
infrastructure: Real blockchain node, real services, EVM snapshots

phases:
  1. Infrastructure: E2E harness, node, snapshots, proof tests (3-4h)
  2. Deploy Workflows: Contract deployment E2E (8-10h)
  3. Component Workflows: Component management E2E (6-8h)
  4. Full Pipeline: Catalog + complete workflows (10-12h)

quality_gates:
  Gate_1: Infrastructure Validation (node + harness work)
  Gate_2: Workflow Passing (100%, execution < 30 min)
  Gate_3: Real E2E Validation (score > 8.5/10, higher threshold)
  Gate_4: ROI Analysis (selective coverage, 10-30 critical workflows)

e2e_harness:
  - Node lifecycle management (start/stop/reset)
  - EVM snapshots (40x speedup for isolation)
  - State management (create/revert/restore snapshots)
  - Validation helpers (on-chain state, contracts)

anti_patterns:
  - Integration at E2E Level (wrong scope, wastes expensive infrastructure)
  - Hard-Coded Timeouts (flaky tests, use event-based waiting)
  - No State Isolation (test pollution, use snapshot reset)
```

**Example command:**
```
"Execute Phase 1 using @e2e-test-build.mdc method"
```

**What happens:**
1. AI creates E2E harness (node lifecycle, snapshots, validation)
2. Starts real blockchain node (Hardhat/Ganache)
3. Creates 3 infrastructure proof tests (node, snapshots, environment)
4. Develops complete workflow tests (Deploy → Initialize → Activate → Upload → Register)
5. ROI analysis → selective coverage (10-30 critical workflows, not 200+)

**Result:** Production-ready E2E tests validating critical user journeys with real infrastructure

### 2.3 Examples from Current Session

#### **Case 1: Starting work with UUPS adaptation**

**Command:**
```
"@bridge.md write based on context processing and integration
after this we'll continue together"
```

**What happened:**
1. AI read bridge.md (full project context)
2. Understood: UUPS architecture, dependencies, current state
3. Ready to work **without additional questions**

**Alternative without bridge:**
```
User: "Need to adapt deploy_full.js to UUPS"
AI: "Tell me about project structure"
User: [500 tokens of explanations]
AI: "What contracts exist?"
User: [200 tokens]
AI: "What's already done?"
User: [300 tokens]
...
```

**Savings:** ~1000 tokens and 10-15 minutes

---

### 2.4 Token Efficiency

#### Comparison table:

| Task | Classical Approach | Zeya888 + Rules | Savings |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|---------|
| **Session start with context** | 500-1000 tokens (retelling) | 5 tokens (`@bridge.md`) | **100-200x** |
| **Execute command** | 25-40 tokens ("Please...") | 1-5 tokens (`execute Phase 3 using @run-task.mdc`) | **5-40x** |
| **Error diagnosis** | 30-50 tokens ("Help me understand...") | 1 token (`identify`) | **30-50x** |
| **Quality analysis** | 100-200 tokens (explain criteria) | 10-15 tokens (`using @test-qualification.mdc method`) | **10-20x** |
| **Result validation** | 40-60 tokens ("Check if correct...") | 5-10 tokens (`validate by AC`) | **4-12x** |

---

## 3. Interaction Style: Imperative DSL

### 3.1 Zero Politeness Pattern

#### Definition

**Zero Politeness** — interaction pattern where all "polite wrappers" are eliminated:

```
❌ "Please, could you..."
❌ "It would be great if..."
❌ "Thanks! Can I also..."
❌ "Sorry to bother, but..."

✅ execute
✅ identify
✅ validate
✅ using method X
```

**Don't confuse with rudeness!**

Zero Politeness ≠ rudeness. This is **precision and efficiency**, not emotional coloring.

#### Linguistic Structure

**Classical "polite" style:**
```
[Greeting] + [Request] + [Condition] + [Thanks] + [Task]
"Hi! Can you help if not difficult? Would be great [task]. Thanks in advance!"
```

**Tokens:** 20-40  
**Useful payload:** ~25% (only [task])  
**Efficiency:** 25%

**Zeya888 Imperative DSL:**
```
[Imperative verb] + [Object] + [Method (optional)]
"execute Phase 3 using @run-task.mdc method"
```

**Tokens:** 5-7  
**Useful payload:** 100%  
**Efficiency:** 100%

**Savings:** 4-8x on tokens + higher accuracy

#### Psychology of Zero Politeness

**Why 95% don't use:**

1. **Cultural conditioning**
   - In human communication: politeness = effectiveness
   - Automatically transfers to AI
   - Requires **conscious disabling** of this pattern

2. **Anthropomorphization (humanizing AI)**
   - "Please" makes AI more "human" in perception
   - Creates communication comfort
   - **Zeya888:** AI = tool/partner, not virtual human

3. **Fear of appearing rude**
   - Even knowing AI doesn't get offended
   - Discomfort from "rude" commands
   - **Zeya888:** No emotional load, pure efficiency

4. **Unconsciousness**
   - People don't analyze: "How many tokens on politeness?"
   - **Zeya888:** Conscious optimization of every word

#### Zero Politeness Principles:

1. **Every word = useful payload**
2. **Imperative verbs** (execute, identify, validate)
3. **Zero redundancy** (no "please", "thanks", "can you")
4. **Composability** (commands easily combine)

### 3.2 Statistics: Why Most Don't Do This?

#### Style Distribution (from AI experience):

│                                                  │
│ Direct (but not imperative) │ 0.9%             │
│ "Create function X"                             │
│                                                  │
│ Imperative DSL (Zeya888)    │ 0.1%             │
│ "execute using method X"                        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

## 5. Cursor-Specific Features

### 5.1 @ Syntax for Rule Activation

**Pattern:** `@filename.mdc` activates methodology directly in command.

```
"execute Phase 3 using @run-task.mdc method"
"check tests using @test-qualification.mdc method"
"@bridge.md write based on results"
```

**Advantage:** AI instantly loads methodology without explanations.

### 5.2 Journals as Persistent State

**AIJournal.md = session external memory:**
- All decisions documented
- All errors and fixes logged
- Structured logging (ListX/ItemY)
- AI reads journal as source of truth

**Example:**
```
User: "execute next"
AI: [reads AIJournal.md, finds next pending ItemY, executes]
```

**State survives AI restart** — stored in file, not chat memory.

### 5.3 Reference by Example

**Pattern:** `@template_file.js` as template for new code.

```
"create tests for ProductRegistry using 
@OrganicComponentRegistry.UUPS.test.js as template"
```

**What happens:**
1. AI reads template file
2. Extracts patterns (structure, style, approach)
3. Applies to new task
4. **Result:** Consistent style without explicit explanation

**Savings:** 0 tokens on "explaining how to write", AI copies from template.

---

## 6. Failure Modes & Recovery

### 6.1 Typical Failures

**Failure Mode 1: AI executes wrong plan item**
- **Cause:** Implicit reference to ItemY
- **Example:** "execute next" (but AI didn't check what's completed)
- **Symptom:** Skipped steps or duplicate work

**Failure Mode 2: Dialogue degradation**
- **Cause:** Context > 200k tokens
- **Symptom:** AI loses focus, contradictions, slow responses

**Failure Mode 3: AI doesn't apply methodology**
- **Cause:** Forgot to specify `using @rule.mdc method`
- **Symptom:** AI chooses approach itself, lower quality

**Failure Mode 4: False task understanding**
- **Cause:** Insufficiently detailed command
- **Symptom:** AI does wrong thing

**Failure Mode 5: Error accumulation**
- **Cause:** Validation skipped, transition to next ItemY without check
- **Symptom:** Series of dependent errors

### 6.2 Recovery Methods

**Recovery 1: Explicit validation**
```
User: "validate by AC, perhaps it's ready"
AI: [checks, confirms or reports problems]
```

**Recovery 2: Bridge Pattern on degradation**
```
1. "create bridge.md for current state"
2. [Close session]
3. [New session] "@bridge.md — continue"
```

**Recovery 3: Quick diagnosis**
```
User: "identify"
AI: [diagnoses root cause, proposes fix]
```

**Recovery 4: High-level correction**
```
User: "you're writing about X but item 2 of plan is Y, validate"
AI: [switches to correct item]
```

**Recovery 5: Rollback to last valid state**
```
User: "return to last completed ItemY from @AIJournal.md"
AI: [reads journal, rolls back, continues]
```

## 7. Heuristics & Resonance Metrics

### 7.1 How to Determine AI Answer "Correctness"?

**Heuristic 1: AI provides Acceptance Criteria**
- ✅ **Good:** AI creates YAML with criteria before execution
- ❌ **Bad:** AI immediately starts coding without criteria

**Heuristic 2: AI references journal/plan**
- ✅ **Good:** "Reading Phase 3 from AIJournal.md..."
- ❌ **Bad:** AI works "from chat memory"

**Heuristic 3: AI validates before transition**
- ✅ **Good:** "ItemY1 completed, checking by AC before ItemY2"
- ❌ **Bad:** Immediately moves to next

**Heuristic 4: AI explains root cause**
- ✅ **Good:** "Problem: activator uses someone else's invite. Cause: contract logic..."
- ❌ **Bad:** "Let's try to fix this way..."

**Heuristic 5: AI uses activated methodology**
- ✅ **Good:** Follows @run-task.mdc structure (7 steps)
- ❌ **Bad:** Ignores methodology, does it own way

### 7.2 Interaction Quality Criteria

**Criterion 1: Token efficiency**
```
Command should be < 10 tokens for routine operations
Command 10-20 tokens for complex operations
```

**Criterion 2: Zero ambiguity**
```
AI shouldn't ask clarifying questions for standard commands
If AI asks → command not clear enough
```

**Criterion 3: Structured output**
```
AI should log to journal, not just to chat
State should be in external memory
```

**Criterion 4: Self-validation**
```
AI should check result by AC itself
Not wait for user to "check correctness"
```

**Criterion 5: Methodology compliance**
```
If @rule.mdc specified, AI must strictly follow
Not "free interpretation"
```

### 7.3 Success Metrics

**Metric 1: Success Rate**
```yaml
Target: 95-100% tasks completed first try
Current session: 
  - Phases: 6/6 (100%)
  - ItemY: 18/18 (100%)
  - Tests: 82/82 (100%)
```

**Metric 2: Iteration Count**
```yaml
Target: 3-5 iterations to final result
Current session:
  - deploy_full.js adaptation: 4 iterations (including debug)
  - SpiralEngine tests: 1 iteration (11/11 first time)
  - ProductRegistry tests: 1 iteration (6/6 first time)
```

**Metric 3: Token Efficiency**
```yaml
Target: 80-90% savings on communication vs classical approach
Current session: ~90% savings (455 tokens instead of 5,500)
```

**Metric 4: Zero False Positives (in tests)**
```yaml
Target: 0 false positives in tests
Result: @test-qualification.mdc identified all gaps, 
        new tests check real functionality
```

**Metric 5: Context Recovery Time**
```yaml
Target: < 1 minute for context restoration
Result: "@bridge.md — continue" = 30 seconds
```

## 8. FAQ/Playbook for Developers

### 8.1 Where to Start?

**Step 1: Start with zero politeness**
```
Instead of: "Please, help me with..."
Write: "execute X"
```
Overcome psychological barrier. AI doesn't get offended.

**Step 2: Create first Rule**
```markdown
# analysis-simple.mdc
When activated:
1. Read task
2. Break into 3-5 phases
3. For each phase create acceptance criteria
4. Fix in AIJournal.md
```

**Step 3: Practice command style**
```
"analyze using @analysis-simple.mdc method"
```

**Step 4: Add external memory**
```
Create AIJournal.md in project root
AI command: "log all decisions in AIJournal.md"
```

**Step 5: Iteratively improve**
- After each session: what worked? what didn't?
- Update Rules based on experience
- Crystallize successful patterns

### 8.2 How to Create Your Rule?

**Rule structure:**
```markdown
# rule-name.mdc

## Purpose
[What this Rule is for]

## When to use
[In what situations to activate]

## Cognitive mode
[What approach AI should apply]

## Process
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
...

## Output format
[How result should look]

## Principles
- [Key principle 1]
- [Key principle 2]
```

### 8.3 Common Newbie Mistakes

**Mistake 1: Don't specify methodology**
```
❌ "do analysis"
✅ "analyze using @analysis.mdc method"
```
**Consequences:** AI chooses approach itself, result unpredictable.

**Mistake 2: Don't validate after each step**
```
❌ "execute all phases"
✅ "execute Phase 1 using @run-task.mdc method"
   [validation]
   "execute Phase 2 using @run-task.mdc method"
```
**Consequences:** Error accumulation, difficult debugging.

**Mistake 3: Ignore journal**
```
❌ AI works "from chat memory"
✅ AI reads AIJournal.md as source of truth
```
**Consequences:** State lost on restart, no decision history.

**Mistake 4: Use polite forms**
```
❌ "Please, could you..."
✅ "execute"
```
**Consequences:** 20-40x more tokens, lower clarity.

**Mistake 5: Don't create bridge on degradation**
```
❌ Continue bloated session until complete failure
✅ At 200k tokens: create bridge, restart
```
**Consequences:** AI loses focus, contradictions, time waste.

### 8.4 Testing Rules Quick Start

**Scenario 1: Building Unit Tests from Scratch**
```
Step 1: "Execute Phase 1 using @unit-test-build.mdc method"
Step 2: AI creates infrastructure (runner, mocks, helpers)
Step 3: AI generates 60-100 smoke tests (existence checks)
Step 4: Validate 100% passing → auto-trigger @test-qualification
Step 5: "Execute Phase 2 using @unit-test-build.mdc method"
Step 6: AI creates real tests (functionality validation)
Step 7: Ship at 8.5+/10 (ROI analysis)

Result: Production-ready unit tests in 8-15 hours
```

**Scenario 2: Adding Integration Tests**
```
Step 1: "Execute Phase 1 using @integration-test-build.mdc method"
Step 2: AI creates multi-module harness + test database
Step 3: "Execute Phase 2 using @integration-test-build.mdc method"
Step 4: AI validates module contracts (boundaries, API, data)
Step 5: "Execute Phase 3 using @integration-test-build.mdc method"
Step 6: AI tests multi-step workflows (2-4 modules together)

Result: Production-ready integration tests in 10-15 hours
```

**Scenario 3: Building E2E Tests**
```
Step 1: "Execute Phase 1 using @e2e-test-build.mdc method"
Step 2: AI creates E2E harness (node, snapshots, validation helpers)
Step 3: AI starts real blockchain node + creates proof tests
Step 4: "Execute Phase 2 using @e2e-test-build.mdc method"
Step 5: AI develops deployment workflow E2E tests
Step 6: Continue with Phase 3 (components) and Phase 4 (full pipeline)

Result: Production-ready E2E tests in 32-40 hours, 40x speedup with snapshots
```

## 9. Risks & Ethics

### 9.1 Over-reliance on AI

**Risk:** Developer stops thinking, completely relies on AI.

**Zeya888 protection:**
- **Acceptance Criteria mandatory** — developer must understand WHAT is needed
- **Explicit validation** — developer checks result
- **Methodologies require understanding** — can't apply @test-qualification without understanding P0/P1/P2

**Correct usage:**
```
AI = power tool, not thinking replacement
AI accelerates execution, doesn't replace analysis (human)
```

### 9.2 Loss of Critical Thinking?

**Myth:** "If AI does everything, brain atrophies"

**Reality:** Zeya888 **strengthens** critical thinking:

1. **Creating methodologies** — requires deep process understanding
2. **@test-qualification.mdc** — teaches strict quality analysis
3. **Acceptance Criteria** — requires clear requirement formalization
4. **Result validation** — critical evaluation of AI output

**Effect:** Developer thinks on **meta-level** (methodologies, processes), AI works on **execution level** (code, tests).

**This is elevation, not thinking degradation.**
