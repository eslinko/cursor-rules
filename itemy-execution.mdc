# ✍️ Step: Controlled Implementation of ItemY

## 1. Execution Context
```yaml
execution_context:
  implementation_plan: [Reference to plan]
  acceptance_criteria: [Reference to criteria]
  environment: [Development | Staging | Production]
  dependencies:
    - [Dependency 1]
    - [Dependency 2]
```

## 2. Step-by-Step Execution
```yaml
executed_step:
  step: "Create input validation layer"
  action: >
    [Detailed description of changes made]
  linked_criteria: [AC1, AC3]
  change_log:
    file: [path/to/file]
    lines_modified: [start–end]
    diff_summary: >
      [Brief summary of changes]
  self_review:
    passed: [true | false]
    rationale: >
      [Explanation of review outcome]
```

## 3. Plan Deviation Handling
```yaml
plan_deviation:
  reason: >
    [Clear explanation of why deviation was necessary]
  approved_by_criteria: [AC0]
  justification_level: [high | medium | low]
  impact_assessment:
    - [Impact 1]
    - [Impact 2]
  mitigation_plan: >
    [Plan to address potential risks]
```

## 4. Execution Summary
```yaml
execution_summary:
  steps_completed: [number]
  criteria_fulfilled: [AC0, AC1, AC2, ACmeta]
  remaining_risks:
    - [Risk 1 with mitigation plan]
    - [Risk 2 with mitigation plan]
  quality_metrics:
    - [Metric 1]
    - [Metric 2]
  ready_for_validation: [true | false]
  next_steps: >
    [If not ready, describe what needs to be done]
```

This file will:
- Ensure strict adherence to implementation plan
- Log every action with clear traceability
- Validate against acceptance criteria
- Document and justify any deviations
- Maintain clear connection between actions and criteria
- Prepare for validation phase
