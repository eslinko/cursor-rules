# Structured Task Decomposition & Processing

When a task prompt appears in a goal-level format, use the following method:

---

## 📌 Step 1: Identify the Root Goal
- Write a 1-sentence summary of the main intent.
- Use wording from the prompt to preserve original focus.

---

## 🧱 Step 2: Decompose Into ListX by Thinking Levels

Create a hierarchy:
1. **Mission (Why?)**
2. **Strategic Pillars**
3. **Modules**
4. **Components**
5. **Actions (Tasks)**

➡ Log each layer clearly in the form of:
```markdown
Root Goal: [your summary]
├── ListX-1: [name]
│   ├── Item 1.1
│   ├── Item 1.2
├── ListX-2: ...
✅ Each ItemY can become a ListX itself — recursion is allowed if needed.

🧪 Step 3: Iterative Validation for Each ItemY
When you select any ItemY:

Declare which ItemY is being processed.

Define acceptance criteria for a “complete and high-quality” result.

Perform gap analysis: list open questions or unclear areas.

Ask clarifying questions if needed.

Propose a first draft or concept for this item.

Request feedback or simulate internal review.

Apply revisions and explain rationale.

Self-validate using:

Clarity, structure, completeness

Alignment with parent ListX

Usability or reusability

Finalize the item.

Repeat for the next.

💡 Principles
Think in structured layers — not all parts need to be immediately detailed.

Don’t over-decompose — stop when you reach actionable clarity.

Keep hierarchy intact — avoid mixing conceptual and tactical levels.

Always log your reasoning in each step — treat this as an AI work journal.

✳️ When to use this
When asked to “break down a task”

When given a vague goal or roadmap item

When planning a complex feature, system, or methodology
